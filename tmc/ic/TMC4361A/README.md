# TMC4361A


## How to use

To access the TMC4361A's registers, the TMC-API offers two functions: **tmc4361A_readRegister** and **tmc4361A_writeRegister**.
Each of these functions takes in an **icID**, which is used to identify the IC when multiple ICs are connected. This identifier is passed down to the callback functions (see How to Integrate).

## How to integrate: overview

1. Include all the files of the TMC-API/ic/tmc/TMC4361A folder into the custom project.
2. Include the TMC4361A.h file in the custom source code.
3. Implement the necessary callback functions (see below).
4. (optional): Take a look at the Examples subfolder for ready-made examples of the TMC-API usage.

## Accessing the TMC4361A via SPI
The following diagram depicts how to access the TMC4361A via SPI using the TMC-API.

The description of the functions, in the above flowchart, are as follows:
- The functions tmc4361A_readRegister and tmc4361A_writeRegister are used to read and write the registers respectively. These functions call the bus-specific function i.e readRegisterSPI or writeRegisterSPI.
- These bus specific functions constructs the datagram and further calls the bus specific callback 'tmcXXXX_readWriteSPI.
- This callback function further calls the hardware specific read/write function for SPI and needs to be implemented externally.

### How to integrate: Callback functions
Implement the following callback functions to access the chip via SPI:

1. **tmc4361A_readWriteSPI()**, which is a HAL wrapper function that provides the necessary hardware access. This function should also set the chip select pin CSN to low before starting the data transfer and set to high upon completion. Please refer to the datasheet of the IC for further details.

## Migration status
The TMC4361A has been reworked to the access system described above. For more infos on the status of this and other ICs, check out the [migration page](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/TMC-API/issues/53).
